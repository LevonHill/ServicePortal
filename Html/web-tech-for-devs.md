The open Web presents incredible opportunities for developers. To take full advantage of these technologies, you need to know how to use them. Below you'll find links to our Web technology documentation.



Accessibility — Making websites usable for people with disabilities (ARIA, semantic HTML, etc.).

CSS — Styling and layout of web pages.

HTML — Structure and semantics of web content.

HTTP — The protocol for web communication (headers, methods, status codes, caching, etc.).

JavaScript — Programming language for web interactivity and logic.

MathML — Markup for displaying mathematical notation in web documents.

Media — Working with audio, video, and other media elements on the web.

Performance — Techniques for optimizing speed and efficiency.

Privacy on the web — Guidance on protecting user data and respecting privacy.

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) — Building installable, offline-capable web apps.

Security — Web security best practices (HTTPS, CORS, CSP, etc.).

SVG — Scalable Vector Graphics, used for vector-based graphics and animations.

URIs — Understanding and managing web addresses and identifiers.

Web APIs — Browser-provided APIs (DOM, Fetch, Web Storage, Canvas, etc.).

WebDriver — Automation for testing browsers (Selenium, etc.).

XML — Data markup language still used in some web contexts.

So yes — it’s basically the core table of contents for MDN’s Web documentation section, covering nearly everything fundamental to modern front-end web development.

If you’re learning web dev, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in that list is ideal before moving into HTTP, APIs, and performance/security topics.
